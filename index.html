         <p>Happy Monthsary, today marks the 4 months of our relationship. The day we became one and decided to be with 
          each other forever. A wonderful and dreamy 2025 ended, and we step into a new year together. 2025 was really 
          special for me, the year in which I met you, and felt what it means to be loved. It was a year of lessons,
           which started harshly and completely transformed into the most memorable year all coz I met you. You guided me,
            stood by me whenever I felt low, and motivated me. Love, you are my biggest strength, and with your love and 
            prayers, I feel protected. I don’t have the words to describe how much you mean to me, every word that I think
             of seems less to justify the kindness, care, humility, and pure-hearted you are. I hope you are happy with me,
              and I’ll keep improving myself so that you can always be proud of choosing me, and I can always keep you happy.
               I’ll give my best so that not a tear comes to your eyes. You made me feel like the most loved person on earth, 
               and you keep showering your love. You have been fighting your silent battles alone, but now I want to be with
                you in all your hardships. Together, we will overcome all difficulties and grow towards achieving our goals.
                 The most important thing for me is to be with you soon. All I want is to be your safe place, a person whom 
                 you can share all your feelings with, and feel like home with me.</p>

         <p>We entered the new year together on the video call, a truly magical moment for me. It made me feel like I was there 
          with you, and all I wished in that moment was to hug you, see you smiling, enjoying. I miss you very much, crave to
           see you, sit beside you and just stare at you, hug you, care for you when you are unwell. I really hope that this 
           year I can visit you and spend a few days with you, and I’ll try my best to make it happen. Love, I promise that 
           I’ll become better, follow the advices that you gave, so you don’t get worried, and I can be the person who gives
            you all the happiness you deserve. We will grow together, our love getting stronger and stronger, 
            take care of each other, and I pray that god keeps you always healthy and eases your way towards your dreams. 
            I can’t wait for the day we get married and then never have to say bye and good night on text. My biggest
             blessing from god is you, and I am so eagerly waiting the day we officially become husband and wife. 
             I am yearning to be with you very much and soon I am going to visit you. Thank you so much, love.</p>

         <p>I love you</p>

          <p>With all my heart,<br>— Akash</p>

            <h2>1 — Strangers</h2>
            <p>Two lives, apart and unknown.</p>

            <p>
            Looking back at the year, we were strangers, didn’t know about each other's existence, 
            busy in our own world. Destiny brought us together, we went to the same dating app, and on 
            that particular day, I decided to text you with the belief that I might get a reply and maybe
             we could be friends and have someone to talk. Not knowing that you were my other half, we started
              talking and soon became friends. I’ll forever be grateful to god that he made us meet, and now we are one.
            </p>

            <p>
            September does have a very important place in my heart for the day we expressed ourselves, but I will always
             cherish the month of June, in which I texted you first, the month in which our journey from strangers to
              becoming soulmates started.

            <h2>2 — First spark</h2>
            <p>A message, a smile — the beginning.</p>
            <p>Love, let’s recap our starting days and the journey of two hearts becoming one.</p>

            <p>Remember our first talk was so formal, talking about hobbies, discussing some China–Philippines issues, and
               a revelation that we are from different countries. There was always a spark, some feeling that I needed to talk 
               with you, even though we barely knew each other, and still, I wished to talk with you all day. I used to prepare
                things to talk to you, so the conversation never ended. For the first time, I had someone to delay my dinner just
                 to spend some more time talking.</p>

            <p>And from here, our journey took place from being just friends to becoming best friends.</p>

            <h2>3 — Growing closer</h2>
            <p>Messages, late nights, small moments.</p>
            <p>The dreamy phase starts, our friendship grows, and we develop a strong bond.</p>

            <p>I remember we started to discuss our childhood, fun experiences, telling stories and sharing lots of reels. 
              You sent your childhood photo in a view-once mode, and love, you looked so cute—gosh, the cutest. We started 
              talking till late at night, began to have small fights, and you even once mentioned that we haven’t had any fights
               yet and would like some fun fights.</p>

            <p>I started falling for you, or maybe I had already fallen in love and just couldn’t realise it. Our souls accepted 
              each other, and only the realisation was left.</p>

            <h2>4 — Falling</h2>
            <p>You became my home.</p>
            <p>Love, it was the day of Janmashtami, the birthday of lord Krishna and a thought appeared, maybe I am in love with
               you. It was also the day we talked the most, and we started to be more open with each other. I felt love, thinking
                about you all day, watching your dreams, getting excited by your texts. I wanted to tell you, but delayed it coz 
                I was unsure how you would react. The feeling of love is so deep that it couldn’t be contained, and then on the
                 beautiful day September 3, I expressed myself and got to know that you, too, have the same feeling for me. With
                  tears rolling down my cheeks, I was smiling and jumping in my room, with the joy of being chosen by you. I am 
                  still falling for you every day, feeling blessed to be a part of your life. You are my Devi, my princess,
                   my baby, my best friend, my guide, and much more. I pray that with each passing day, our love keeps growing, 
                   and you always remain happy and healthy, all your problems be transferred to me. I want to be with you in all
                    my lifetimes.</p>
